- I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), working with [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis).
- Before joining Brown, I received my B.Eng. degree in [Department of Thermal Engineering](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/teen/index.html) at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in 2013.
- My current research interests are on deep learning theory and scientific machine learning. My broad research interests focus on computational biology and high performance computing.
